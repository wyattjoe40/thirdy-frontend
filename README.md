## Thirdy

[Thirdy](https://www.Thirdy.app) was a website I created as a 30-day challenge to learn React and NodeJS. The website allows users to participate in and track 30-day challenges (how meta!).

## Thirdy Frontend

This repo is the frontend portion of the Thirdy website. It is built in React using a combination of Hooks and Class React.
